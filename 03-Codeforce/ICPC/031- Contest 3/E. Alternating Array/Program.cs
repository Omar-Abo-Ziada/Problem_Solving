   time limit per test1 second

   An array of integers is said to be alternating if each element has a different sign than the one next to it.

   i.e.
    for each element in the array such that (0≤i<n)
    , only one of these conditions must be met:-

   if ai<0
    then ai+1>0
   .
   if ai>0
    then ai+1<0
   .
   For example, [1, -3, 2] and [3] are alternating arrays, while [1,-3, -2] and [1, 2] are not.

   You are given an array a
    of n
    integers, in one operation, you are allowed to choose a number and multiply it by -1 (change its sign). what is the minimum number of operations required to convert the given array into an alternating array.

   Input
   The first line contains an integer n(1≤n≤105)
    the number of elements in the array a

   The second line contains n
    integers ai(−50≤ai≤50,ai≠0)
    the elements of the array a
   .

   Output
   Output the minimum number of operations needs to convert the given array into an alternative one.
