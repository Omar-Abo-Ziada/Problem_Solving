 Given a number N and an array A of N numbers. Determine if the array is lucky or not.

 Note: the array is lucky if the frequency (number of occurrence) of the minimum element is odd.

 Input
 First line contains a number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000) number of elements.

 Second line contains N numbers ( - 105 ≤ Ai ≤ 105).

 Output
 Print "Lucky" (without quotes) if the frequency of the minimum element is odd, otherwise print "Unlucky"(without quotes).

 Unlucky
 Note
 First Example :

 minimum element is 5 and its frequency is 1 and it's ODD so the array is lucky.

 Second Example :

 minimum element is 3 and its frequency is 4 and it's EVEN so the array is not lucky.
